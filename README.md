# Hangman JS

### Background

This is a basic implementation of Hangman written in vanilla JS and HTML.
It includes basic functionality of selecting a word from a set list and allows the user to guess letters with their keyboard. It has very basic functionality including a button to reset the game and win/loss detection.

##### Updates

1/6/2022: Reformatted functions to arrow functions, fixed a bug that allowed the code to continue taking incorrect guesses after the game has already been won.
